                    <p>
                    This program is designed for students who need guidance with their daily homework. It is ideal for students who are still in the process of building their study habits, or who need help in preparing for daily tests in school. Students may choose to have their sessions one-on-one, or in groups of 2-4. We offer Daily Pillars for all school subjects, or only for specific subjects. But don’t expect your tutors to do the work for you! Daily Pillars is a healthy mix of guided and independent work.

                    Having trouble in Math or English? Then Strengthening Pillars is for you. This program is designed to help students in subject areas where remediation is needed. It aims to help students recover prerequisite skills, and to bring them to the level of skill at par with his current grade level. We offer Strengthening Pillars in the following skills/subject areas:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Math (All subjects)</li>
                        <li>Science (General Science, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)</li>
                        <li>English (Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        An initial assessment is administered to determine the student’s current skill level. The results will then be used in designing the best-fit program for the student. All Strengthening Pillars sessions are one-on-one.

                        Benjamin Franklin hit the nail on the head when he said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” When it comes to something as life-changing as getting into a good university, college, or senior high school, nothing beats good preparation. In Pillars, we offer college review programs aligned with the Ateneo College Entrance Test (ACET) and UP College Entrance Test (UPCAT), as well as the Ateneo Senior High School Aptitude and Placement Exam (ASHAPE). Take practice tests and review high school lessons, and face those entrance tests with greater confidence!
